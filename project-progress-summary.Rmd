## data

### NEON Data

Files concerned with downloading and cleaning the NEON data used for this 
project are found in the `data-curation`. The scripts are in the `R/` 
sub-directory and were run in order of their leading number. 

The eight sites that we are primarily concerned with are HARV: Harvard Forest, 
ORNL: Oak Ridge National Laboratory, SCBI: Smithsonian Conservation Biology
Institute, BLAN: Blandy Experimental Farm, SERC: Smithsonian Environmental 
Research Center, STEI: Steigerwald Land Services, UNDE: University of Notre 
Dame Environmental Research Center, and MLBS: Mountain Lake Biological Station.

The downloaded data products can be found in `data-curation/data/eight_sites/`
and include:

* Small mammal trapping data

* small mammal tickborne pathogen status

* small mammal DNA barcodes

* plant presence and cover data

* vegetative structure data

* tick drag cloth sampling

* tick pathogen status

* litterfall trap data (including seed mass)

* beetle pitfall trap data

* precipitation

* biological temperatures

### Non-NEON data

In addition to the data collected by NEON directly, we will utilize two 
additional data sets collected by our groups (for a subset of NEON plots
from 2022 to 2024):

* Activity timing: We have collected
temperature-derived estimates of when individual small mammals entered NEON 
traps. These estimates are outlined in the [activity timing](#activity-timing)
section below.

* Refined infection estimates: Marty Martin's group (USF) has utilized a far
more sensitive method for detecting *Borrelia* infection status of *Peromyscus*
than the NEON protocol uses. As of 27 May 2025, these data are are not yet
compelete.

* Immune expression: Marty Martin's group has also performed gene expression
analyses for *Peromyscus*, which indicate the immune response of individuals. 
As of 27 May 2025, these data are not complete but we have a preliminary 
subsample of these data to work with.

## capture timing 

The `activity-timing/code/scripts` folder contains the code used to generate
the small mammal capture timing data set. The main files are those with leading
digits (00 - 05). These analyses were completed for the 2024 data in April 
2025 and the resultant data can be found in 
`activity-timing/data/ibuttons/capture-time-estimates_2024.rds`. These data
are combined with the prior years (cacluated by Ali Brehm) in the
`capture-time-estimates_2022-2024.rds` file. These `.rds` files are R data 
objects and can be loaded with `readRDS()`.

## Progress Updates

### Analysis Log

<!-- TODO: Revise this -->

I created a markdown file 
(`infection-modeling/code/R/rmarkdown/01_full_model_data.Rmd`) to track the 
initial exploration of relationships between the key NEON variables, working
toward building a full model of *Peromyscus* infection with *Borrelia*.

### Pathogen and capture time overlap

One important insight from the analysis log is the number of samples that we
have for which *both* individual mouse pathogen status (based on NEON's 
collections) and capture time estimates (from ibuttons). As of 2025-05-15, 
there are 354 individuals that meet this criteria in 2022, but of these only 24
individual *Peromyscus* that tested positive for *Borrelia*. In 2023, there are
125 total individuals, of which only 1 tested positive for *Borrelia*. Pathogen
status data won't be available until October 2025. This likely means that we
will need to rely on the Florida group's *Borrelia* sampling.

### Seed Mass

Another important insight is that within NEON's litterfall collections
exists coarse estimates of seed biomass. This, along with beetle biomass and 
primary productivity estimates, will allow us to estimate a proxy for resource
availability. The caveat for this is that litterfall plots vary greatly in their
distance from the small mammal trapping plots.

Preliminary results suggest that there is no compelling correlations between
site-level seed mass and capture timing of individuals, but this might be worth
revisiting after better aligning the data temporally.

### Infection Model

I have begun to create a graphical representation of a model for factors that
directly impact *Peromyscus* infection probability:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Peromyscus-infection-model.drawio.png")
```

I expect that, a model of the probability of *Peromyscus* infection with
*Borrelia* is most directly affected by:

* Whether or not the individual has been bitten by a tick, represented by
"Ticks attached". Within NEON, we have 4 potential variables addressing this:
the number of ticks attached (binned: 1-5, 6-20, >20), and the presence of each
larval, nymphal, and adult ticks. It is unclear at this time which of these will
best predict infection - but my best guess is nymphal tick presence and number
of ticks.

* The probability that a tick is infected with *Borrelia*, represented by 
"*Borrelia* prevalence". This information can be derived from the tick sweep
net surveys, wherein tick populations are sampled and tested for *Borrelia*.

* The immune response of an individual, represented by "immune expression". The
expression data gathered by the S. Florida team, which contain the number of 
RNA copies for key immunological pathways.

* The sex, weight, and age of an individual; the immune response is likely to
vary by these factors within a population. Therefore, these variables should
explain some of the missing immune variation not captured by "immune expression".
We may want to consider adding reproductive status to this list of factors, 
since reproductive males may be less resistant than non-reproductive males.

I have not included any environmental variables because they are not likely to
have direct impacts on an individual's infection once it has been bitten with
an infected tick. There is an argument that harsh temperatures and limited
resources may reduce an individual's resistance to the pathogen, but I expect
those factors to be accounted for by body condition. **Perhaps this is an
inappropriate assumption.**

**One important issue to consider** with these data are the timing of pathogen
testing. Recaptured individuals that have already been tested are never retested
to my knowledge. This means that we can only be sure of an individual's pathogen
status the first time it is tested (which may or may not be the first time it is 
captured).

### Contact Model Conception

After formulating the infection model, I realized that it makes sense to hold
off on fitting this model, given the current data limitations (see 
[Pathogen and capture time overlap](#Pathogen-and-capture-time-overlap)).
Instead, I shifted towards thinking about modeling mouse contact with ticks.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Tick-attachment-model.drawio.png")
```
The 4 possible metrics of tick attachment that are available from NEON data are
the total (binned) number of ticks attached ("# Ticks attached"), and the
presence of each larval ticks ("Larvae attached"), nymphal ticks ("Nymphs 
attached"), and adult ticks ("Adults attached"). For now, I assume that the 
factors affecting each tick attachment metric are the same, with the exception 
of total number of ticks attached, which is affected by the other tick metrics.
These factors are:

* Tick population density, represented by "Tick density". More ticks increase
the chances of a mouse running into one.

* Mouse activity, represented by "Capture time" (when the individual
enters the trap and, therefore, is active) and "Movement distance" 
(the average distance between traps of recaptured individuals). We may also want
to include the average number of times a mouse is captured and/or the number of
unique traps it has been captured in.

* Body size (or weight) and Sex, since movement behaviors vary by these factors.
Age and reproductive status may also need to be considered for the same reasons.

* Temperature and precipitation, because they may affect the behavior of ticks

* habitat structure, or land cover type, which may influence how mice utilize
the space and if/when they physically overlap with tick habitat.

### Contact model fitting
